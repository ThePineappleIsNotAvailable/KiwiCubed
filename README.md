## Very extremely early tech test

I FINALLY HAVE A NAME FOR THE ENGINE
<br/>
<br/>
This is going to be a game engine that I will eventually build a game upon.
But It should be decoupled from the game, and therefore usable for other purposes.

Currently working on:
- Chunk handling system with world class for loading, unloading and rendering.
- Adding support for multiple block types, such as grass blocks and stone blocks, along with attributes for (future) gameplay.
- Completely overhauling backend systems. Don't ask why window handling logic was in the camera class, or why the player had two sets of coordinates, one of which it didn't use.

Features implemented:
- Simple terrain generation for chunks.
<br/>
Taking a long time for me to finish the world class currently.
