# Voxel Engine
## Very extremely early tech test

Still does not have a real name
<br/>
<br/>
This is going to be a game engine that I will eventually build a game upon.
But It should be decoupled from the game, and therefore usable for other purposes.

Currently working on:
- Chunk handling system with world class for loading, unloading and rendering.
- Adding support for multiple block types, such as grass blocks and stone blocks, along with attributes for (future) gameplay.

Features implemented:
- Simple terrain generation for chunks.
<br/>
Taking a long time for me to finish the world class currently.
