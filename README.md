# KiwiÂ³
## v0.0.1pre-alpha
(version system subject to change)


This game / engine is focused on being extremely expandable, having easy and powerful modding support, being ultra performant, and having official tools for creating content and mods that anyone can use and get the hang of.
<br/>

Currently working on:
- glMultiDrawElementsIndirect (dear god why the heck is it so hard to get this to work)
- Chunk handling system with world class for loading, unloading and rendering.
- Adding support for multiple block types, such as grass blocks and stone blocks, along with attributes for (future) gameplay.
- Completely overhauling backend systems. Don't ask why window handling logic was in the camera class, or why the player had two sets of coordinates, one of which it didn't use.
