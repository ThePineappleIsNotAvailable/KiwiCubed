I FINALLY HAVE A NAME FOR THE ENGINE

<br/>
<br/>
This is going to be a game engine that I will eventually build a game upon.
But It should be decoupled from the game, and therefore usable for other purposes.

Currently working on:
- glMultiDrawElementsIndirect (dear god why the heck is it so hard to get this to work)
- Chunk handling system with world class for loading, unloading and rendering.
- Adding support for multiple block types, such as grass blocks and stone blocks, along with attributes for (future) gameplay.
- Completely overhauling backend systems. Don't ask why window handling logic was in the camera class, or why the player had two sets of coordinates, one of which it didn't use.
